The code seems to run fine with collective operations with MPI primitive
datatypes like MPI_INT, but it hangs when used with MPI user-defined
datatype, like vector.

The total rewrite of datatype hash checking code that replaces the broken
(actually unfinished) code seems to fix the hangs mention earlier.  The
code now passes all the tests in mpich2/test/mpi/coll excepts those that
involve inter communicators.
