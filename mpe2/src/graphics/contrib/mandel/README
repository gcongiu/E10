Parallel Mandelbrot in MPI
Written by Ed Karrels, karrels@mcs.anl.gov

This is a demo of the graphical tools built into MPE.  It includes
rudimentary drawing routines and some simple mouse handling routines.

A listing of command line options will be printed if run with the '-h'
option.

When not reading coordinates from a file and -zoom is not specified,
after an image is complete the program will wait for the user to drag
the first mouse button over a region.  When the mouse button is released,
the program will zoom in on the selected region.

Sorry, there is no good way to shut down the program when it is running
in a loop through an input file or with zooming active.  I'm working on it...

For example, to start by viewing the entire set with the option to zoom:

  pmandel -rmin -2 -rmax 2 -imin -2 -imax 2 +zoom
  (This is the default, so you could do the same with just 'pmandel')

Try including the 'cool.points' file to see a series of interesting
regions (zoom is disabled when reading from input file):
  
  pmandel -i cool.points -loop
  (good demo!)
