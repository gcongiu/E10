1, investigate if base.drawable.Coord class's lineID needs to be Integer
   instead of int.  A performance issue with lineID to rowID mapping used
   in base.drawable.{Primitive,Shadow}'s drawState().

2, separate the code that reads slog2's treenode from the main event
   dispatching thread, i.e. increase overlap.
