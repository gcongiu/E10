The package is developed based on SUN's Java 2 SDK.  The non-CLOG related
code can be compiled by older JDK like Solaris_JDK_1.2_01_dev06_fcsV.

A Jave 2 Run Time is required to run the code.
To install this package without any compilation, do

<slog2sdk>/configure --disable-build \
                     --with-trace-libdir=<libTraceInput.so_path>
                     --with-trace-name=CustomTraceFormatName
make
make install PREFIX=<slog2sdk_install>

Where configure will locate the Java Virtual Machine, java, in
the user's PATH or some standard locations.  Or one can supply
the installed directory of Java Run Time through --with-java.

The --with-trace-libdir is used only if the build platform has
a custom TRACE-API implemention, i.e. besides CLOG, and you intend
to generate slog2 file from this custom TRACE-API implementation.
If used, 2 extra scripts, traceprint and traceTOslog2, will be created 
in bin/ to make use of this custom TRACE-API implementation in 
interpreting the trace file and to create slog2 file.

Option --with-trace-name is meaningful only when --with-trace-libdir is
used.  The --with-trace-name allows user to rename the utility
programs, traceprint and traceTOslog2, to something more meaningful.
Essentially, it replaces the prefix "trace" in the program names by the
new trace-name specified in the option --with-trace-name, e.g. rename
traceTOslog2 to mylogTOslog2.


To rebuild everything, one simply issues the command

<slog2sdk>/configure --with-trace-libdir=<libTraceInput.so_path>
make
make install PREFIX=<slog2sdk_install>

Configure will try to locate the programs like javac, jar,... in the user's
environmental variable PATH or some standard known location for Java 
installation.  If Java Developer Kit, j2sdk, is installed in some special 
location, user can inform configure through option --with-java.

Also, in order to compile TRACE-API's JNI, a C compiler is needed.
Configure will automatically search one.  If there is more than one
C compiler available, the compiler can be specified through the 
environmenatal variable, CC, when the TRACE-API sample implementation 
is configured.  The build process is written based on libtool, so it is 
supported only for the platforms that are sypported by libtool
(i.e. most Unixes and Cygwin under Windows).  If you are not interested
in this feature, you could disable it through --disable-sample.



To enable debugging support, i.e. the java source files are needed to be
compiled with -g.  Two way of doing that:

Either through configure,
<slog2sdk>/configure .... JFLAGS=-g
make
make install PREFIX=<slog2sdk_install>

Or through make,
<slog2sdk>/configure ....
make JFLAGS=-g
make install PREFIX=<slog2sdk_install>



To enable the verbose option of the java archive process (i.e. using jar),
add "JARFLAGS=v" during make:

<slog2sdk>/configure ....
make JARFLAGS=v
make install PREFIX=<slog2sdk_install>
