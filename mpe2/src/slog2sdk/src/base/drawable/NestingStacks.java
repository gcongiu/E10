    /*
       Given the NestingStack of the timeline that the Drawable is on,
       Compute the NestingFactor, nesting_ftr.

       It seems NestingFactor cannot be cached, as Zoom-In operations
       bring in the real Drawables that are represented by the Shadows.
       These Drawables needs all the other real Drawables to be presented
       on the NestingStack to have their NestingFactor computed correctly.

       Assume all drawables are arranged in increasing starttime order

       In order to guarantee that both real drawables and shadows which
       may overlap on another but not totally enclosed one another, a
       scheme is needed to make sure they can be drawn and displayed
       continuously/seamlessly across different images in ScrollableObject.
       Object in the nesting stack will be popped until a totally
       covering drawable is found, i.e dobj.covers( cur_dobj ).
       The previous criterion,  
           cur_dobj.getEarliestTime() < dobj.getLatestTime()
       is not enough to guarantee a continuous and seamless drawables
       across images.  Overlapped drawables cannot be drawn nested, because
       when overlapped drawables spread between 2 neighoring images, they 
       may not be both within in 2 neigboring images.  The nesting_stack 
       algorithm seems to work faultlessly for perfectly nested states 
       across different images.  Therefore, extending criteria of popping
       nesting stack to search of perfect nested states seem doing the trick.
